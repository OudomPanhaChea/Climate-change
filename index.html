                Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the
                global climate. These changes affect temperatures, weather
                patterns, and ecosystems. It can occur naturally, because of the
                changes in the sun's activities or major volcanic eruptions.

              <p class="para">
                However, according to the United Nations (2023), since the 19th
                century, human actions have been the primary cause of climate
                change, not only because of the burning of fossil fuels such as
                coal, oil, and gas but also deforestation and industrial
                processes. These activities release large amounts of greenhouse
                gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), which trap heat in the
                atmosphere, leading to global warming (United Nations, 2023).

                The consequences of climate change are vast and include rising
                global temperatures, melting polar ice caps, sea-level rise, and
                more frequent extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts,
                and floods (United Nations, 2023). Climate change not only
                threatens the natural world but also human health, food security,
                water supply and economic stability.
