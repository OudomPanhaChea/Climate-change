                Solving climate change requires coordinated action at multiple
                levels such as individual, governmental, and international. One
                of the most important steps we can take is to transition away
                from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources, such as solar,
                wind, and hydroelectric power (Turrentine, 2022). Governments
                can implement policies that promote energy efficiency, reduce
                carbon emissions, and encourage sustainable practices in
                agriculture and industry. International cooperation, such as the
                Paris Agreement, plays a vital role in uniting countries in the
                fight against climate change (World Wildlife Fund, 2022).

                While governments and corporations play a crucial role in
                tackling climate change, individuals can also make a significant
                impact through their choices and behaviours. Everyone does not
                have to be a policymaker or scientist to make a difference in
                combating climate change. Individuals can reduce their carbon
                footprints by making eco-friendly lifestyle choices.

                According to the United Nations (2020), this is a list of what
                you can do as an individual:

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <span>Save Energy at Home: </span>Use less energy by reducing
                  heating and cooling, use energy-efficient appliances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Switch to Renewable Energy: </span>Install solar panels
                  to generate renewable energy for your home.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Walk, Bike, or Use Public Transport: </span>Reduce car
                  usage by walking, biking, or taking public transport to lower
                  greenhouse gas emissions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Switch to an Electric Vehicle </span>Consider an
                  electric or hybrid vehicle to reduce emissions from gas or
                  diesel-powered cars.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span>Reduce, Reuse, Repair, and Recycle: </span>Buy less,
                  shop second-hand, and recycle. Repair items instead of
                  replacing them to reduce waste and emissions.
                </li>
