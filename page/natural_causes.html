                  A portion of global warming can be linked to natural events.
                  Throughout the history of our planet, volcanic eruptions,
                  variations in the amount of solar energy received, and minor
                  changes in the way our planet moves around the sun have all
                  resulted in noticeable impacts on the patterns of warming and
                  cooling on Earth (Turrentine, 2022).

                  However, climate data can demonstrate that the current increase
                  in global temperatures is occurring much faster than ever
                  before. Moreover, according to Turrentine (2022), even though
                  these natural causes are still active, their impact is too minor
                  to account for the rapid warming observed in the past few
                  decades.

                The primary cause of climate change is the increase in
                greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere as these gases trap
                heat from the sun, creating a "greenhouse effect.". Human
                activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels like coal,
                oil, and natural gas, release large amounts of carbon dioxide
                (CO2) and methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). As stated by
                the United States Environmental Protection Agency (2024), the
                levels of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the
                Earth's atmosphere have reached higher levels than at any point
                in the past 800,000 years. The rise in greenhouse gas emissions
                has intensified the greenhouse effect, leading to an increase in
                the Earth's surface temperature.
