                  The impacts of climate change are wide-ranging and affect
                  nearly every aspect of life on Earth. One of the most
                  immediate consequences is the rise in global temperatures,
                  which has led to more extreme weather events. Heatwaves have
                  become more frequent and severe, causing heat-related
                  illnesses, the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue
                  fever in warmer regions and deaths, particularly among
                  vulnerable populations like the elderly and those living in
                  poverty (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
                  2021).
                </p>
                <p class="para">
                  Climate change also accelerates the melting of glaciers and
                  polar ice caps, contributing to rising sea levels. Coastal
                  areas are at risk of flooding, and small island nations face
                  the existential threat of being submerged.

                  Additionally, climate change is disrupting ecosystems as an
                  increase in sea levels can bury corals under sediment.
                  However, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                  Administration (2021), coral reefs also face numerous impacts
                  from climate change such as rising temperatures can result in
                  coral bleaching, and more intense hurricanes can wipe out
                  entire reefs. Coral reef habitats support a vast array of
                  species, all of which depend on the well-being of the coral
                  reefs for their existence.

                <p class="para">
                  Moreover, some species have evolved by broadening or moving
                  their living areas and when that happens, it could negatively
                  impact other species that are already present in the new
                  location (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,
                  2021).
