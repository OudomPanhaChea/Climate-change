                  Mitigation refers to the effort of preventing or reducing the
                  emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere to make
                  the impacts of climate change less severe. One of the most
                  effective ways to mitigate climate change is by transitioning
                  to renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and
                  hydropower (World Wildlife Fund, 2022). These sources generate
                  electricity without producing greenhouse gases and can
                  significantly reduce the worldâ€™s reliance on fossil fuels. In
                  addition, we must stop deforestation and bring back our
                  natural environments until we achieve net-zero carbon
                  emissions, which means that the amount of greenhouse gases
                  being released into the air should be equal to the amount
                  being absorbed and stored in areas such as the roots of trees
                  (World Wildlife Fund, 2022).

                  Adaptation involves preparing for the negative impacts of
                  climate change and taking the necessary steps to avoid or
                  reduce the harm they might lead to, or seizing the
                  opportunities that may arise. According to the World Wildlife
                  Fund (2022), the initial action in adapting to climate change
                  is recognizing the specific dangers in your area and creating
                  strategies to handle them. Adaptation strategies include
                  developing drought-resistant crops and changing planting
                  seasons to match new climate conditions. In urban areas,
                  adaptation efforts focus on building infrastructure that can
                  withstand extreme weather events, such as flood barriers, and
                  heat-resistant buildings (World Wildlife Fund, 2022). Also,
                  making sure to manage food and water properly to prepare for
                  extreme weather events.
